# 🎫 Ticketing Workflow Simulation Homelab Portfolio

Welcome to my Ticketing Workflow Simulation hands-on lab portfolio.

This repository section showcases practical, ticket-based IT service management (ITSM) simulations designed to reflect real-world Tier 1 / Tier 2 IT Support, Microsoft 365 administration, and identity security support scenarios.

All tickets were performed within a Microsoft 365 trial tenant and endpoint homelab environment and documented using structured helpdesk workflows, ITIL classification methodology, administrative remediation procedures, and service validation screenshots.

# 🌐 Network Troubleshooting Homelab Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Troubleshooting hands-on lab portfolio.

This repository section showcases practical, ticket-based network troubleshooting simulations designed to reflect real-world Tier 1 / Tier 2 IT Support and enterprise network support scenarios.

All labs were performed in a virtualized homelab environment and documented using structured troubleshooting methodology, command-line diagnostics, and validation screenshots.
